coon[0] and i met on the weekend on 15 th and 16 th for a small hackend (you get it? Hack and weekend)



Some weeks ago we met and discused some stuff. During that conversation a idea arvided. What if we could send the data of a scale to a server?

In the last days, I play around a lot with graphan and graphite. So would *love* to get some of my metrics into this. 



In store you can get very cheap digital scales. There are not quite precised, but well for measuring humans. It would be awesome o get
the data, displayed on the LCD somewhere else. This way you could automated the process, instead of always writing it down by hand.
Besides, it eliminates me as an error factor. 

Coon's idea is simple yet elegant. We open up such a digital scale and just add some wires to the LCD display and catch the data to a 
ESP. So it was decided. We will a have get tougher and hack some scales. 


## Getting a Scale 

I got a new scale . 


### Feature

Besides of just measuring your weight, the modern scales own another unique feature nowadays. They can tell apart the amount of fat, water and substances is composed of. The "Bioelectrical impedance analysis" method is used for this. 

On the surfrace of the scale are two small metal plates. This plates are put under power (0.8 mA) DC with a 50 Hz. Afterwards, the scales measures the values and can tell based on the values how much fat you have. 

This method is quite error prune, represents however a very interning set of data you might would not get to otherwise.
 




## dismantle the scale




The scale was quite 'sticky'. It is impressive how cheap such devises is assembled.

You can just 'remove' the entry plastic block that holds the electronics. 


Once the block is removed from the bottom side of the glas a small PCB is unveiled. It is the controller of the scale that does
all the magic. 
















## The end? 

So what is the state of this? 

We have to figure out how the LCD is connected to. WE played around a lot with the devies and broke some the scales. Our reaserach showed
some promois looking documenation that will help us. We will just need another get tougher and continues on understanding the Hardware.
